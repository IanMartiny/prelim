        \caption{Computational PIR leverages homomorphic encryption to make private queries to a database. A user encrypts a vector of 0s and a 1 corresponding to the desired entry, the server can then leverage homormorphic multiplication and homomorphic addition to return the requested entry without learning what was requested.}
