    People are now beginning to focus on their privacy. This has lead to people
    being more aware of the tools they use and what data they allow
    third-parties access to. People are still interested in the services being
    provided but wish to keep their sensitive data private. There are tools that
    allow this type of privacy ranging from anonymous communication tools to
    secure computations in the cloud which use cryptographic techniques to
    leverage private information to complete computations. In this paper we
    examine the different methods that tools can use to preserve anonymity. In
    particular we look at anonymous communication, private information retrieval
    (PIR), zero knowledge proofs, secure computation, and differential privacy.
